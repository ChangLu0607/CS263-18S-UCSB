2. Installed pypy on local machine

**Apr.19**
1. Installed pypy on ubuntu container
2. Have problem on installing ironpython on ubuntu container
- required dot net CLI
- after installing dot CLI, we used 'msbuild' to build .exe out of IronPython.sln file
- build is not successful
- possible solution: [artical1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45664694/instaling-ironpython-for-linux) / build .exe in windows first, then copy it to ubuntu
3.
